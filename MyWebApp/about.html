        <p> Jackie Davis, a student at the University of New Mexico has been advocating for a crosswalk on Central Avenue near Buena Vista Drive. Observing hundreds of people crossing the street, Jackie attended several council meetings and met with officials from the Department of Municipal Development (DMD). Her persistence paved the way for a crosswalk design that has been implemented and is awaiting funding. This map provides data from several crossings in Albuquerque, their crossing frequencies, and methods of traffic control. The DMD is in the process of determining which crossings take priority for traffic control. This site aims to aid in this process while providing crossing information to the public.</p>
