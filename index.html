    <h3>Geographer, Future Lawyer</h3>
    <p>I am graduating next month with my Bachelor of Science in Geography with a focus in GIScience. After graduation, I will be attending the University of New Mexico School of Law as a full time student. I am passionate about all things transportation policy. Specifically, I am interested in how the law shapes our spaces based on the modes of transportaiton we choose to take. Whether it be the Bus, Bike, Skateboard, or Walking, I hope to shape the future of transportation policy so we can all get home safely.</p>
  <p>Below, you can find informaiton on my latest projects. While I have been working with the City of Albuquerque on traffic safety GIS (Geographic Information Systems), I also undertake some of my own projects in and around Albuquerque. Stay Tuned, more to come...</p>

      <h3>Buena Vista & Central Crossing Project</h3>
    <p>In the Spring of 2024, I undertook a project to get the city to add a crosswalk at the intersection of Buena Vista and Central, close to the UNM Campus. I observed traffic for a period of 4 hours and presented my findings to the City Council. The City is now planning to include a <a href="https://www.cabq.gov/municipaldevelopment/featured-projects/citys-first-hawk-signal" target="_blank">Pedestrian Hybrid Beacon</a> at that location as a part of a larger project to connect the North Channel trail to the South Valley. This project will result in students who attend UNM after me to be able to safely get to and from class every day.</p>

    <h2>Crossing Locations at and Near UNM</h2>
  <p>The link below will link to a web app that details pedestrian crossing locations on the UNM main campus. It will be updated when data is taken on the crossing locations. Currently, the button uses a placeholder link that will take you to UNM Geography Department's main page.</p>
